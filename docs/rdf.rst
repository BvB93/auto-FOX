Radial Distribution Function Generator
======================================

A radial distribution function (RDF) generator reader has been implemented in the FOX.functions.radial_distribution_ module.
The radial distribution function, or pair correlation function, describes how the particale density in a system varies as a function of distance from a reference particle.
The herein implemented get_all_radial() function is designed for constructing RDFs between all possible (user-defined) atom-pairs.
